Book genre classification using LSTM and NLP techniques

# Book Genre Classification using LSTM ðŸ“š

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project classifies book genres based on their title, description, and author information using an LSTM-based deep learning model. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization and word embeddings are used for preprocessing.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Text data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Tokenization and sequence padding  
- Word embeddings for text representation  
- LSTM-based classification model  
- Accuracy and loss visualization

## ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Keras, TensorFlow  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  

## ðŸ“Œ Status
Completed as an academic deep learning project.
